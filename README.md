# Employee-Management-System
## Description
This is an employee management system that was built to help you organize and keep track of your employees, departments, and roles within your company. This solves the issue of having to keep physical records of your employees, and having to remember their department or roles. I learned a lot during this project, especially how picky my SQL is with syntax.

## Installation
_**For easy installations:**_

SQL Installation: [SQL Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Node installation : [Node Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


## Usage
In order to properly use the program, you will need to have node installed, as well as my SQL. Once you have those and download the program, you'll need to type "npm install" or "npm i" into the terminal of the opened server.js file, this will download all of the related packages imported into the program. Once you do that, just type "npm start" into the command line and the application should have no issues running.
